# MethodWrapper
Method wrappers are simple ways to way to perform simple dynamic analysis.

For now this repository is just to archive the code found on squeaksource/MethodWrappers. 
I just took the most recent version named MethodWrapper42.girba.1.mcz from 2012. 

I do not intent to harvest the previous version but feel free to do it and send me PullRequests. 
I will happily integrate them. 

For now I do not intent to make it work but who knows. 
Again if you want to make them work in latest Pharo, I'm super interested to know it and would like 
to archive it.
